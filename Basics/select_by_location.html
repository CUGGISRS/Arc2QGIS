	<h2>Select By Location</h2>
	</br>
	<p>
	QGIS does have a spatial selection tools, jsut like ArcGIS's <i>Select By Location</i>, it's also called Select By Location but has somewhat less options in the base tool.</br>
	The tools is accessed either via the top menu bar -> Vector -> Research Tools, or by Searching for it by name in the processing toolbar.</br></br>

	<img src="img/select_by_location.png" height=350px width=450px/>
	</p>
	<p>
	The tool is easy to use, lets take for our purpose a point layer and polygon layer, they look like this:</br></br>
	<img src="img/select_by_location_db1.png" height=600px width=650/></br>
	as you can see, some of the features in the point layer are <b>within</b> the polygon layer.</b></br>
	what we'll do is select those features using <b>Select By Location</b>, when clicked this is the window opened:</br></br>
	<img src="img/select_by_location_db2.png" height=600px width=600/></br>
	we want to select features from the point layer, and compare them to all features from the polygon layer (since no features are selected within the polygon layer.</br>
	the relation we want to check is "which features from 'A' are <b>within</b> 'B'".</br>
	This is our result:</br></br>
	<img src="img/select_by_location_db3.png" height=600px width=600/></br>
	</br>
	And thats it, Simple and easy to use, and now you know how to do that in Open Source.
