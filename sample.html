  <head>
    <title>Enter the name of the tool you are replacing here</title>
    <!example title>Select By Location<!/title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Each paragraph should be entered inside an opening <code>'<p>'</code> and a closing <code>'</p>'</code> tags.
  like this:</br>
  <code><p>This is a paragraph about selecting features by location</p><code>
  </br>
  every image you want to add should be added to the <i>img</i> folder within the toolbox folder.
  after the image file exists within the <i>img</i> folder you should enter it into an <code>'<img>'</code> tag:</br>
  <code><img src="img/select_by_location.png" width="250" height="250"/></text>
  <img src="Basics/img/select_by_location.png" width="250" height="250"/></br>
  width and height are set in pixles and you can change them to make sure the image is shown properly.</br>
  if you want to add code blocks you can enter them just like text paragraphs inside <xmp>'<code>'</xmp> tags.</br>
  And that's it, just add as many paragraphs and images as you need.</br>
